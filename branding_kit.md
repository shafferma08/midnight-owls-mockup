# Midnight Owls Branding Kit & Social Strategy

> **"Print Bold. Create Fearlessly."**

## 1. Brand Identity Overview

**Midnight Owls** (formerly Groovy Graphics) is a creative collective and premium print studio. We live in the details. We aren't just a print shop; we are partners in creation for brands, bands, and businesses that value quality over quantity.

*   **Vibe:** Sophisticated, Nocturnal, Creative, Industrial, Premium.
*   **Voice:** Confident, knowledgeable, slightly mysterious but approachable. We speak with authority on craft ("We don't use acrylics") but with the warmth of a local partner.
*   **Mission:** To provide industry-leading screenprinting and design services with obsessive attention to detail, bridging the gap between artistic vision and tangible product.

## 2. Visual Identity

### Color Palette
Our palette is high-contrast and moody, anchored by deep darks and highlighted by premium metallics and electric accents.

*   **Midnight Black:** `#0B0B0E` (Primary background, deep and rich)
*   **Owl Gold:** `#D6A24A` (Primary accent, luxury, warmth, "Gold Standard")
*   **Electric Teal:** `#1BB3B0` (Secondary accent, energy, creative spark)
*   **Off-White:** `#F5F5F7` (Text, clean, modern)
*   **Cool Gray:** `#A0A0A5` (Secondary text, subtle details)
*   **Magenta Plum:** `#8E44AD` (Rare accent for creative flair)

### Typography
*   **Headlines:** `Montserrat` (Weights: 600/700/800) - Uppercase, bold, geometric. Used for maximum impact.
*   **Body:** `Inter` (Weights: 400/500) - Clean, highly readable, modern screen font.
*   **Technical/Data:** `Space Grotesk` - Used sparingly for numbers or technical specs (optional).

### Logo Usage
*   **Text Logo:** **Midnight** **Owls** (Weight 800 for "Midnight", Weight 400 or lighter for "Owls" is a common variation, or standardizing on the bold "Midnight" with a lighter "Owls" span).
*   **Icon:** The "Owl Eyes" or abstract geometric owl (future asset).
*   **Usage:** Always used in Off-White or Gold on dark backgrounds. Avoid placing on busy patterns without a "glass" backing.

## 3. The Rebrand: Groovy Graphics &rarr; Midnight Owls

**The Narrative:** This isn't just a name change; it's an evolution. "Groovy" was our roots—fun, local, established 1999. "Midnight Owls" is our future—precise, tireless, and elevated.

**Key Talking Points for Social:**
*   *"The same team you trust, working later than ever."*
*   *"Groovy spirit. Midnight work ethic."*
*   *"We’ve graduated from 'Groovy' to 'Gold Standard'."*
*   *"Established 1999. Reimagined 2026."*

## 4. Social Media Strategy

### Aesthetic Direction
*   **Dark Mode Everything:** heavily utilize black/dark gray backgrounds for posts.
*   **Macro Photography:** Close-ups of ink texture, squeegees, thread counts on embroidery. Show the *craft*.
*   **Process Reels:** ASMR-style printing videos. Slow-motion flood strokes. Peeling DTF film.
*   **"Glassmorphism" in Graphics:** Use semi-transparent overlays for text on photos, mimicking the website style.

### Content Pillars & Hashtags
1.  **The Craft (Educational):** Explaining Plastisol vs. Water-base, how embroidery works.
    *   `#ScreenPrintingLife #PrintShop #Plastisol #EmbroideryArt`
